# HELP WANTED!

This is a list of things that need to be done in the project. If you want to help, but don't know where to start, this is a great place to look.

## General
This is a small solo project that I have been working on for a long time, and any help at this time is on a volunteer basis only. You will be fully credited if you help out, and future royalties or compensation (if any) can be negotiated. Realistically this project will probably not make a profit, but who knows? 
General feedback is always welcome. If you have any suggestions, please let us know!

## Story - Writing
See [WIKI.md](/WIKI.md) for more information on the current story.

As of 11/1/2022, the story is still being written and nothing is yet set in stone. A general idea can be found in [WIKI.md](/WIKI.md), but at this point I am open to change, ESPECIALLY if you have a better idea and a desire to write it. I CAN write the story, but I prefer to leave that to more creative minds if possible. 

## Code
I am refactoring the old working demo from a LAMP stack (PHP-Laravel, MySQL, some JS) to Ionic Angular and Firebase. The old code is in the [old](/old) folder. The new code is in the [src](/src) folder. I will be updating the interface, layout, logic, and adding new features as well. 

I welcome any help with the code. It is private on GitHub, but I can add you as a collaborator if you want to help. If you are familiar with Ionic Angular and/or Firebase and want to help, please let me know.

## Accessibility

This game was originally conceived with accessibility in mind. It is playable with a screen reader on desktop and mobile. I am currently working on making it more accessible, but I am not an expert in this area. If you are an expert in accessibility and want to help, please let me know. I also welcome any testers who are blind or visually impaired or use a screen reader.

If you have any other accessibility suggestions, please let me know. 

## Design - Art

While this game is meant to be low graphics, I still need artists and designers to help. Low graphics does not have to mean low quality. I am looking for artists who can create a unique look and feel for the game. I am also looking for designers who can help with the interface and layout keeping accessibility in mind. We want this game to be visually appealing for the players who can see, but also easy to use for those who cannot. I prefer a realistic art/photography style, but I am open to other styles as well. See the [WIKI.md](/WIKI.md) for more information and examples of the current art style and gui.

## Music - Sound Effects

I am looking for atmospheric and epic adventure music and sound effects. I am also looking for sound effects for combat, monsters, and other game elements.

## Marketing

It is hard to have a MMORPG without players. I am looking for people who can help with marketing and promotion. I am also looking for people who can help with social media and other forms of promotion. Twitch streamers welcome! This type of game will cater to a smalll but loyal audience, so I am looking for people who can help build that audience.

## Testing

If you just like playing games or even breaking them, let me know and I will give you a toy to play with lol! I am looking for people who can help test the game and report bugs. I am also looking for people who can help test the game with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Other

If you have any other skills or ideas that you think would be helpful, please let me know. I am open to any ideas and suggestions.
