The council here in the village of Ishandar has had their fair share of scandal these days, and Solias was determined to clean house. Some of the other elders did not like his plans for the future of the council.</p>
<p>If you want to help Old Solias escape, I can tell you how. But first you must prove yourself capable and worthy. There is a pyramid just west of here. They say inside there is a stela that has on it inscribed the whereabouts of a great treasure. Bring me the stela, and I will share with you my plan to rescue Solias.</p>";
