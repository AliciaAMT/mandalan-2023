Graphics Mode is best for those who can see or use a magnifier, and Text Mode is best for those who are totally blind.</p><p>This game takes place in the fantasy land of Mandala. In Mandala you will find magic, weapons, armor, treasure, quests, and honour. Find your way back to your own world, and save another if you have the courage to enter...</p><p>Notice! This game is currently under development, hopefully to be part of a series called Mandalan Tales. Since the game is only a demo, it is totally free. Your character is continuously saved on the server, so you do not need to save your game, and if your internet browser crashes, your game will not be affected. Additions to the game are made continuously so check back often for updates. </p><p><b>Development News:</b><table class="border1"><tr><td class="border1"><b>10/18/2009</b></td><td class="border1">There is a bug in Firefox that cuts off some forms, especially in battle when you die. I suggest using IE for now until the bug is fixed.</td></tr><tr><td class="border1"><b>10/17/2009</b></td><td class="border1">Fixed the Flee action in battle, fixed some text mode pages including Quest Journal and some other random bugs.</td></tr><tr><td class="border1"><b>10/14/2009</b></td><td class="border1">I am finding more and more bugs in the game, particularly in the fighting. Please bear with me. I should have fighting fixed in a week or so. As of right now you may only "Attack" the rat by the table downstairs. All other actions may not work.</td></tr><tr><td class="border1"><b>10/9/2009</b></td><td class="border1">My server was hacked resulting in making the game unplayable for new characters. This is now fixed. If you come across any other problems please email me at owner@mandalantales.info, thank you! You should be able to play inside the first house and fight the rat now, although skills may not work correctly yet. I am still updating the game.</td></tr><tr><td class="border1"><b>9/7/2009</b></td><td class="border1">Major update in the works. Changes made so that you can create one account based on your email, and with each account you may create up to 6 characters. These characters and your other friends in the game will be able to trade goods and interact. While the game will not be truly multiplayer, this will still foster a feeling of comradery amongst players. There will also be a major update to the database which will allow the server to funtion much faster resulting in faster page loads, especially during battle.</td></tr><tr><td class="border1"><b>7/24/2009:</b></td><td class="border1">Playable. You can roam your father's house, gather supplies, go into the cellar, and kill monsters. There are a few starter quests, and I am currently working on Ishadar Forest map and the Barn. I also need to make a major update for text mode.</td></tr></table> <br />Send questions or comments to alicia@mandalantales.info</p></td></tr></table>
