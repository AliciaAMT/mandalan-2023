# Mandalan Tales

Inspired by Lands of Hope, Might & Magic, D&D, and other RPGs, Mandalan Tales is a text based, turn based mmorpg (massively multiplayer online role playing game). You can choose from several classes for your characters, and fight monsters for loot, experience, and glory. As you explor the open world, you can team up with other players to take on the toughest monsters, or go it alone. You can also choose to be a merchant, and sell your wares to other players. Like most RPGs, the choice is yours.
