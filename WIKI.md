# Introduction
Inspired by Lands of Hope, Might & Magic, D&D, and other RPGs, Mandalan Tales is a text based, turn based mmorpg (massively multiplayer online role playing game). 

You can choose from several classes for your characters, and fight monsters for loot, experience, and glory. As you explore the open world, you can team up with other players to take on the toughest monsters, or go it alone. You can also choose to be a merchant, and sell your wares to other players. 

Like most RPGs, the choice is yours.

# Pitch

Mandalan Tales: The Revolution

Genre: MMORPG (Turn-Based, Accessible, Persistent, Modular, Fantasy/Sci-Fi)

Platform: Web, PC, Android, Iphone

Audience: Teen+ (Violence)

## Don't just choose your own adventure... create one too!

Mandalan Tales takes place in a multi-verse. Each universe represents an adventure module. Incorporated in Mandalan Tales: The Revolution is a user-created content system that allows players to create their own module, or universe complete with a primary objective unique for that universe. 

After completing the objective of saving the universe in The Revolution, users are able to travel to or create other universes.

## The Revolution - A Crash Course in Multiverse Lore

During a particularly strong thunderstorm, just like a bolt of lightening, you awaken in a strange bed, in a different time, in a different world. 

Quickly you discover that you are somehow responsible to help save this dystopian universe from itself. 

Not only must you survive this medieval-like world by gathering, learning skills, fighting, looting, and of course, magic... but you also seek to solve the mystery of why and how you came to be in this strange alternate universe and find others like you. 

Together you and the other "Lost Ones" must save the universe, then decide whether to stay or go!

## Something For Everyone

### Socialize in chat with other players, and use teamwork to get bigger rewards!

### Kill varieties of monsters for glorious loot and honor!

### Achieve a high position on the leaderboards or a high rank in society!

### Explore a vast universe full of it's own unique lore, and later, a multiverse!

### Accessible for varying abilities and imaginations!

This game was inspired by a blind girl who loved playing RPGs. The goal was to create an attractive, fun game that can be played by people of varying abilities. 

Graphics are present, but for aesthetics only. The game is text-based for screen-readers, and designed to be casual and slow-paced, not only for those of varying abilities and needs, but to allow for use of creativity and the imagination as well!

# Blueprint

## GENRE

High Fantasy / Science Fiction

## ENVIRONMENT

Stoya is an Earth-like planet in a parallel universe. The action takes place in a country the size of Great Britian, in various countrysides and small towns. The country is bordered by mountains on the west, ice in the north, ocean to the east, and desert to the south.

Mandala is the multi-verse where the creator of the game resides at his computer. It is a place where the player can create their own universe, or travel to other universes created by other players. Mandala is timeless.

## KEY PHYSICAL FEATURES

At first glance Stoya appears to be medieval Europe or Arthurian England, but the land of Vash, where the story takes place, is country of strife and monsters unknown to Earth at any point of history unless in myth. The moon is clearly different that Earth's moon, and the stars are in all the wrong places.

## POPULATION

While racial differences seem to mean nothing in this alternative Earth called Stoya, the scales are balanced by the rampant classism, where the poor are trampled by the rich. 

The 1% are in the country's "Council of Elders", or have connections that are. This gives the rich complete control of the government, which of course led to corruption. 

Instead of racism dividing the people, the classism divides them. A further division arises between each class: good and evil.

## OVERVIEW

Stoya is a parallel universe version of Earth, and it is a country much like medieval Europe. Newcomers from our universe would be struck at how the population is unaffected by racism, despite varying races in Stoya similar to Earth's variety. However, any hope from that revelation is dashed when one realizes the depths of the classism and division that plagues this world none-the-less.
